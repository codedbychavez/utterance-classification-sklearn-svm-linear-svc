    "Lets suppose that we are faced with a classification problem in which we are task to build a Salon Virtual Assistant. One of our first requirements is to have the Virtual Assistant be able to classify customer utterances to specific intents. Lets take for example a customer who is asking if he can book an appointment (see dialogue below):\n",

    "**Customer**: Hello! Good Morning\n",

    "\n",
    "**Customer**: I wanna book a haircut\n",
    "\n",
    "**VA**: intent: book_appointment\n",
    "\n",

    "**pandas** - Responsible for reading and converting the `classification_data.json` file to a data frame that will be used as input to train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**train_test_split** - Would be used to split the training data (The utterances and their respective intents from `classification_data.json`) into a training set and a testing set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CountVectorizer** - Responsible for creating a numerical matrix that represents the number of words in each sentence and how often each word appears within each sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can learn how `TfidfTransformer` works, lets first understand what is `tfidf`. `tfidf` (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) is responsible for giving each word in each sentence a unique number depending on how many times the word appear in the sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TfidfTransformer** - Takes the `CountVectorizer` matrix (described above) as input and creates a `tfidf` matrix out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LinearSVC** - This is the classification model we will be training to make classification predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**pickle** - Our reason for using `pickle` here is to be able to save the `CountVectorizer` (a metaclass type object) we imported from `sklearn_feature_extraction.text` to disk so that we can load and use it later. This saves us some processing time since we don't need to reimport the `CountVectorizer` again when we are making a classification prediction.\n",
    "The way how this works is that, with the pickle module, we are able take the `CountVectorizer` object we imported, and convert it into a character stream that would later on be used to reconstruct the `CountVectorizer` when we need to use it."
